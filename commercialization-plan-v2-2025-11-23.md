## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

MobiRides is Botswana's first peer-to-peer car-sharing platform, transitioning from MVP validation to commercial scale. After 10 months of operation (Jan-Oct 2025), we've validated product-market fit with 154 registered users, 56 vehicles, and P247,535+ in revenue—all achieved with zero paid marketing. This represents a 305% growth rate and P24,753 average monthly revenue.

**Current Momentum:**
- Live platform operational since Q1 2025
- Active promotional campaign (Nov 17-Dec 14, 2025): P100 OFF with code FIRST100
- Confirmed partnerships: BIC, Pay-U Insurance, Sekele Fund, Metshelo, Mobile Money (Orange, Mascom, BeMobile)
- Ecosystem validation: BDIH, BoostUp Accelerator, Deverse Labs

**Strategic Direction:**
We're launching a dual-product strategy combining our validated P2P car-sharing platform (15% commission) with an innovative Rent2Buy marketplace (10% platform + 6.5% financing fees) to capture both rental and vehicle ownership markets.

**Funding Status:**
- Secured: P71,500 from Cerberus Capital (P55K January 2025 + P16.5K July 2025)
- Next Round: P700,000 pre-seed **TARGET CLOSE: Dec 15, 2025** (P200K for Rent2Buy revolving fund, P500K for operations)
- **IP Protection:** ✓ Trademark approved by CIPA, international registration in progress

**CRITICAL RISKS (Nov 24, 2025):**
- Fleet concentration: 80%+ from Trillo Rentals (ONLY signed MOU)
- User verification: 95% incomplete (conversion blocker)
- Funding deadline: Dec 15, 2025 (3 weeks)

**2026 Targets:**
- Revenue: P3.44M (P2.59M P2P + P847K Rent2Buy)
- Fleet: 200 vehicles (150 P2P, 50 Rent2Buy)
- Markets: Gaborone, Francistown, Maun/Kasane (Safari)

- **Mitigation:** Prepayment policy, mobile money integration, credit card verification
- **Status:** Mitigated

**Risk 4: Competition from Traditional Rentals**
- **Likelihood:** High (established players)
- **Impact:** Medium (price competition)
- **Mitigation:** 30-40% price advantage, unique inventory (hosts' personal vehicles), convenience features
- **Status:** Competitive advantage validated

### 9.2 Rent2Buy Risks

**Risk 1: Low Financing Penetration**
- **Likelihood:** Medium (unproven motshelo appetite)
- **Impact:** High (reduced revenue per vehicle)

**Risk 4: Customer Default on Financing**
- **Likelihood:** Medium (credit-challenged customers)
- **Impact:** High (motshelo losses, partnership risk)
- **Mitigation:** Vehicle title held by motshelo, repossession clause, MobiRides facilitates resale
- **Status:** Contract terms in development

**Risk 5: EV Market Unproven**
- **Likelihood:** High (early-stage EV adoption in Botswana)
- **Impact:** Medium (limits EV Rent2Buy inventory)
- **Mitigation:** Start with 5-10 EV pilot, focus on Gaborone, monitor govt policy
- **Status:** 2027 timeline allows market maturity

### 9.3 Operational Risks

**Risk 1: Platform Downtime**
- **Likelihood:** Low (cloud infrastructure)
- **Impact:** High (booking disruptions, revenue loss)
- **Mitigation:** Redundant servers, 24/7 monitoring, backup payment systems
- **Status:** Infrastructure in place

**Risk 2: Regulatory Changes**
