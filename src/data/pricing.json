    },
    {
      "question": "Can I upgrade my vehicle mid-term?",
      "answer": "Yes! Your built equity can be transferred to a higher-tier vehicle. We'll calculate your equity value and apply it as a down payment on your new rental-to-buy agreement."
    },
    {
      "question": "What condition must the vehicle be in for buyout?",
      "answer": "Normal wear and tear is expected. A pre-buyout inspection ensures the vehicle meets our standards. Minor cosmetic issues are acceptable; major mechanical issues may require repair or adjustment to buyout price."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need perfect credit?",
      "answer": "No. We use data-driven risk scoring that considers multiple factors beyond traditional credit scores. Consistent income, rental history, and down payment amount all contribute to approval."

    {
      "question": "Is insurance and maintenance really included?",
      "answer": "Yes! Basic insurance and scheduled maintenance are included in your monthly rate. This covers oil changes, brake pads, and routine servicing. You're only responsible for fuel and any damage beyond normal wear."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use the vehicle for business purposes?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Our Rent-to-Buy model is perfect for ride-sharing, delivery services, and logistics. Many of our customers generate revenue that covers their monthly payments."
