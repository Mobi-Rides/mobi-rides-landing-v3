      "question": "Can I upgrade my vehicle mid-term?",

    {
      "question": "What condition must the vehicle be in for buyout?",
      "answer": "Normal wear and tear is expected. A pre-buyout inspection ensures the vehicle meets our standards. Minor cosmetic issues are acceptable; major mechanical issues may require repair or adjustment to buyout price."

    {
      "question": "Do I need perfect credit?",

      "question": "Is insurance and maintenance really included?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use the vehicle for business purposes?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Our Rent-to-Buy model is perfect for ride-sharing, delivery services, and logistics. Many of our customers generate revenue that covers their monthly payments."
