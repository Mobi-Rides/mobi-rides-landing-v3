   - Average car is parked 95% of the time

3. **Expensive Rentals**
   - Traditional rentals: P1,000-1,200/day
   - Limited local options, poor service
   - P250M+/year market dominated by 3-4 players

  - Credit scoring integration (Transunion Botswana)
  - Conservative loan-to-value ratios (85% max)
- **Status:** Product feature designed, pilot will validate

## Presentation Notes for Founders

### Slide-by-Slide Talking Points

**Slide 1 (Cover):**
- Hook: "We generated P247K in revenue without spending a single pula on marketing. Let me show you how."

**Slide 2 (Problem):**
- Start with customer pain: "60% of Batswana can't access traditional car financing. And if they can afford a car, it sits idle 95% of the time."

**Slide 3 (Solution):**
- Position as two-sided: "We solve both problems. Car owners earn passive income. Renters save 30-40%. And soon, everyone can own a car through Rent2Buy."

**Slide 6 (Traction):**
- Lead with P0 CAC: "This is 100% word-of-mouth growth. No ads. No sales team. Just a product people love."

**Slide 10 (Financials):**
- Emphasize profitability path: "We're not burning cash to grow. We're profitable by Month 5, and scaling from there."

**Slide 17 (The Ask):**
- Clear ask + deadline: "We need P700K to get to P4.79M ARR. December 15 deadline. Who's in?"

### Key Objection Handling

**"What if traditional rentals drop prices?"**
- "Our 85% host commission creates a moat. Traditional rentals can't match our economics because they own the fleet. We don't."

**"What if hosts default on Rent2Buy?"**
- "Rental Recovery Mode. The car goes back to earning rental income. We've modeled 5% defaults and still hit 35% margins."

**"Why can't someone copy this?"**
- "They can try. But we have 12-18 months of execution, 154 users who trust us, and partnerships that took us months to build. First-mover advantage is real."

**"How do you compete with banks on Rent2Buy?"**
- "We're not competing. We're serving the 60% they reject. And our 6.5%/month is transparent, flexible, and customer-friendly. No hidden fees. No repossession."

**"What's your exit strategy?"**
- "Three paths: (1) Regional acquisition by OEM (Toyota, VW looking for mobility plays), (2) Consolidation with African mobility platforms, (3) Scale to profitability and hold. All attractive at 35%+ margins."
