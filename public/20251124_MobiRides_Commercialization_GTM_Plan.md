## 9. Pricing & Commercial Model

### Pricing Model

**Two-Product Revenue Strategy:**

**PRODUCT 1: P2P Car Sharing (Live)**

**Commission-Based Model:**
- **Platform Commission:** 15% of booking value
- **Host Earnings:** 85% of booking value
- **Renter Fee:** P0 (no service fees for renters)
- **Payment Processing:** Mobile Money (Orange Money, MyZaka, Smega) - low/no fees

**Example Transaction:**

Platform commission (15%): P157.50
Host payout (85%): P892.50
Platform net revenue: P157.50
```

**Competitive Advantage:**
- **Traditional Botswana Rentals:** P600-900/day
- **MobiRides:** P350-600/day (40% cheaper)
- **Host Earnings:** P3,500-7,000/month depending on utilization
- **No Hidden Fees:** Transparent pricing vs. traditional agency fees

**Current Pricing Structure (Validated):**

|-------------|-----------|---------------------|----------------|
| Economy Sedan | P300-400 | P255-340 | P45-60 |
| Family Sedan | P350-450 | P298-383 | P53-68 |

**PRODUCT 2: Rent2Buy Marketplace (Q2 2026 Pilot)**

- **Vehicle Margin:** P10,000-15,000 per vehicle (repo purchase at P60-70K, sell at P80-90K)

**How Rent2Buy Works:**
1. **Customer Application:** Young professional (25-35), income P5K-12K/month
2. **Down Payment:** P5,000-10,000 (MobiRides retains 20% = P1-2K commission)

4. **Investor Returns:** 6.5% annual return for Motshelo groups (repaid over 36 months)

**Rent2Buy Pilot Economics (3 Vehicles):**
```

Vehicle Cost: P60-70K each × 3 vehicles = P180-210K
Down Payments: P5-10K × 3 = P15-30K (retain 20% = P3-6K)
Monthly Platform Fees: P500-750 × 3 = P1,500-2,250/month
Vehicle Margin at Sale: P10-15K × 3 = P30-45K (over 36 months)
Total Revenue (3 years): P3-6K + P54-81K + P30-45K = P87-132K
Investor Return: 6.5% annually = P39K repaid over 36 months
Net Profit: P48-93K over 3 years
