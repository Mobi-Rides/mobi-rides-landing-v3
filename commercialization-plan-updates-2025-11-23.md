## CRITICAL RISK UPDATE (Nov 24, 2025)

### 🔴 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**1. Fleet Partner Concentration Risk - CRITICAL**
- **Status:** 80%+ of inventory from Trillo Rentals (ONLY provider with signed MOU)
- **Impact:** Platform vulnerable to single partner withdrawal; revenue concentration risk
- **Action:** Sign MOUs with 3-5 additional fleet partners by Q1 2026; target <40% concentration per partner
- **Timeline:** Urgent - Q1 2026
- **Responsible:** CEO + Partnerships Lead

**2. Pre-Seed Funding Deadline - CRITICAL**
- **Deadline:** December 15, 2025 (3 weeks from now)
- **Amount:** P700,000 target close
- **Impact:** Without funding, runway limited to 13 months; Rent2Buy pilot delayed
- **Action:** Complete investor documentation by Dec 15; close commitments from Sekele Fund, Motshelo groups
- **Responsible:** CEO + CFO

**3. Payment System Development Status - CRITICAL**
- **Status:** Payment & Wallet System only 35% complete (vs Booking System 97%, Vehicle Handover 95%)
- **Impact:** Blocks full commercialization launch (Feb 28, 2026 target); revenue processing delays; user drop-off
- **Root Cause:** Technical complexity; integration dependencies with mobile money providers
- **Action:** Prioritize payment system completion to 95%+ by Jan 31, 2026; daily standups; external dev support if needed
- **Timeline:** Urgent - Q1 2026 (blocking Feb 28 commercial launch)
- **Responsible:** CTO + Lead Developer + Product Manager

**4. User Verification Completion Gap - HIGH**
- **Status:** 95% of 154 registered users have NOT completed new 3-step verification
- **Impact:** Limits booking conversions; reduces revenue realization
- **Root Cause:** Old 7-step process too complex; new 3-step not retroactively completed
- **Action:** Automated email/SMS campaign; P50 credit incentive; target 80%+ completion by Q1 2026
- **Responsible:** Product Manager + CTO + Marketing Lead

### ✅ WINS & RESOLVED RISKS
