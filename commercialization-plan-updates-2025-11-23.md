# MobiRides Commercialization Plan Updates
**Date:** 23 November 2025

## Executive Summary

MobiRides is transitioning from a single-product P2P car sharing platform to a **two-product portfolio strategy**:

1. **P2P Car Sharing** (Current): Peer-to-peer vehicle rentals with 15% commission model

## 2. Two-Product Portfolio Strategy

### Product 1: P2P Car Sharing (Current)

#### Business Model
- **Commission:** 15% per rental transaction
- **Host Earnings:** 85% of rental fee
- **Insurance:** Pay-U partnership (comprehensive coverage)
- **Delivery:** On-demand delivery & collection service
- **Booking Speed:** 5-30 minute confirmation time

#### Current Traction (Update with Actuals)
- **Hosts:** [X] active vehicle listings
- **Renters:** [X] completed bookings
- **GMV:** P[X] total transaction volume
- **Average Rental Rate:** P[X]/day
- **Key Partnerships:** Pay-U Insurance, [Other Partners]

#### Revenue Model (P2P)
```
Monthly Revenue = (Total Rental GMV) × 15% commission

Example (Year 1 Target):
- 100 active vehicles
- Average rental: P800/day
- Average utilization: 10 days/month per vehicle
- Monthly GMV: 100 × P800 × 10 = P800,000
- MobiRides Revenue: P800,000 × 15% = P120,000/month
- Annual Revenue: P1.44M
```

---

### Product 2: Rent2Buy Marketplace (Q2 2026 Launch)

#### Business Model
- **Platform Fee:** 10% on all vehicle sales
- **Financing Commission:** 6.5% from financing partners (motshelo/stokvel groups, banks)
- **Total Revenue (Financed Sales):** 16.5% per transaction
- **Total Revenue (Cash Sales):** 10% per transaction

#### Pilot Strategy (Q1 2026)
- **Revolving Fund:** P200,000 to seed initial inventory
- **Pilot Vehicles:**
  1. **Entry-Level** (P80K): Toyota Vitz, Nissan March (mass market appeal)
  2. **Executive** (P60K): Toyota Camry, BMW 3-Series (professionals)
  3. **Utility** (P60K): Toyota Hilux, Ford Ranger (commercial/agri)
- **Vehicle Sourcing:** Repossessed vehicles (cost-effective inventory)
- **Pilot Goals:**
  - Test 3 vehicle categories across buyer personas
  - Validate 10% financing penetration assumption
  - Build case studies for motshelo partnership pitches
  - Refine platform UX before public launch

#### Financing Penetration Targets
- **Q1 2026 (Pilot):** 10% financing penetration

- **Q4 2026:** Target 50% financing penetration
- **Year 2 (2027):** 70%+ as trust and track record builds

#### Revenue Model (Rent2Buy)
```
Revenue per Sale = Vehicle Sale Price × (10% platform fee + [6.5% if financed])

Example Scenarios:

Financed Sale (50% penetration):
- Vehicle: P150,000 (used sedan)
- Platform Fee: P150,000 × 10% = P15,000
- Financing Commission: P150,000 × 6.5% = P9,750
- Total Revenue: P24,750 per vehicle

Cash Sale (50% penetration):
- Vehicle: P150,000
- Platform Fee: P15,000
- Total Revenue: P15,000 per vehicle

Blended Revenue per Sale: (P24,750 + P15,000) / 2 = P19,875

---

## 9. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Rent2Buy-Specific Risks

#### Risk 1: Low Financing Penetration
- **Scenario:** Only 5% of buyers use financing (vs. 10% target)
- **Impact:** Lower financing commission revenue (P50K vs. P100K Year 1)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Conservative projections (start at 10%, not 30%)
  - Multiple financing options (motshelo, banks, cash)
  - Educational marketing: "Why financing helps build credit"

#### Risk 2: Motshelo Partnership Delays
- **Scenario:** Only 5 motshelo groups sign by Q2 2026 (vs. 10 target)
- **Impact:** Limited financing capacity, slower Rent2Buy scale
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start bank partnerships earlier (parallel track)
  - Increase P200K revolving fund to P300K (self-finance more)
  - Extend pilot phase to Q3 2026 if needed

#### Risk 3: Used Vehicle Quality Issues
- **Scenario:** Repo vehicles have hidden defects, buyer dissatisfaction
- **Impact:** Negative reviews, returns, legal disputes
- **Mitigation:**
  - Mandatory vehicle inspection before listing (certified mechanic)
  - 30-day warranty on all Rent2Buy vehicles
  - Transparent vehicle history reporting
  - Partner with dealerships for certified used inventory (Tier 2 strategy)

#### Risk 4: EV Market Unproven
- **Scenario:** Tourist demand for EVs is <5% (vs. 20% projection)
- **Impact:** Dealership partnerships underperform, EV strategy delayed
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start with 5-10 EV pilot rentals (low investment)
  - Test demand data before committing to dealership MOUs
  - ICE vehicles remain 95% of inventory in 2026
  - EV scale in 2027 only if 2026 data validates demand
